## Notice

Last but the most important thing is that you can reference them, but **PLEASE DO NOT COPY**! If you copy this project and get caught, no one can help you, and you deserve nothing but a zero score. 

Heads up! I've inserted something into my code. It will somehow show the identification information of the true author, which is me. So anaing, **DO NOT COPY**.

Good luck and have fun. :)
